## Debug Notes:

### 10/29/25 - 1pm - ~1Hr spent

- Utilized a good amount of ChatGPT for assistance
- The problem was not putting static at line 37 (`random_device rd;`) and 38 (`random_device rd;`) in Game.cpp
- Not having it there accidently generates the same random thing, which will make the function constantly output the same number
    - Used to constantly output 5 without it
- Hopefully no issue in putting static there
- Otherwise the code is functional and probably ready to demo
