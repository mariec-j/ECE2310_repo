### Notes:
“pwd”
- Outputs the path directory the terminal is looking into right now, which is like the direction of files the computer goes through to the file it’ll run.
“ls”
- Lists the contents in the folder in the directory.
- It even says when it was last edited, and how many bytes the file is.
“cd ..”
- Goes back in the directory.
- If the directory is in ‘...\a\b\c’, the directory after using the command goes to ‘...\a\b
“cd Lab1”
- Changes the directory to the folder name.
- The folder must be within the directory.
- It’s possible to put in the argument in quotes (‘’ or “”) just in case the folder name has a space (for instance, my directory included ‘SHOOL TIME’, which made writing the statement “cd SCHOOL TIME” invalid to write without the quotes).
- It is also possible to use the quotes to paste the entire path.
