# About Me

## Objective
Students will learn how to organize data using the data structures, arrays and vectors (i.e. dynamic arrays). 
They will learn the similarities and differences between the two in terms of how they contain, access, and updates 
element as well as to how to pass them into functions. Students will understand how these data structures allocate 
memory and their relation to pointers.


Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** features are completed:

- [x] [array.cpp](array.cpp) is created, coded, and has a working terminal output
- [x] [vector.cpp](vector.cpp) is coded and prints what is expected on terminal
- [x] screenshots of both terminal outputs are provided

The following **bonus** features are implemented:
