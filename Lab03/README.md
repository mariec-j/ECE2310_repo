# About Me

## Objective
From a UML, we're creating a class called "RPG." Students are expected to 
use the idea of accessibilty with scope and/or encapsulation. The class 
is made from a .h and .cpp files, and is tested on the main.cpp file.


Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** features are completed:

- [x] Make RPG.h
- [x] Make RPG.cpp
- [x] Make main.cpp that includes "RPG.h"

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

### main.cpp's output on terminal

- Default constructor had no initializations for the private variables
- I also didn't test if isAlive() outputs false correctly

- Default constructor actually had values for the object
- Also got to test if isAlive() works, and it does

### Notes:
- Default constructor that didn't have any initializations for the object variables 
gives a number to the parameters that seems kinda random
    - I still don't really know what the numbers mean, but online says they're
    indeterminate values
    - I was kind of expecting it to be like 0 or NULL, but it did turn out 
    like that for the string param
